# Validation metrics
We use the mean slicewise intersection-over-union (IOU) over MR exams, and the IOU calculated considering the entire 3d volume occupied by the prostate gland (see *iou2d* and *iou3d* from `metrics.py`). The slicewise IOU is a more penalizing metric. This is because IOU can only be zero or undefined when a MR slice contains no prostate tissue (a MR exam may have many of those). In this case, even a single false-positive pixel makes IOU zero (intersection = 0 and union != 0). Thus, the mean slicewise IOU can be heavely penalized. To make things worse, if the model successufully produces no false-positive, the IOU is undefined (intersection = 0 and union =0).
